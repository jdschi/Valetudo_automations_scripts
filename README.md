A few automations and a script that have been useful with Valetudo in Home Assistant.  All yaml files assume your robot is named `valetudo_p10purobot` which is unlikely
the case for your robot, so change accordingly.  Other changes are explained in the file comments.

 - `update_valetudo_vacuum_room_list.yaml`: First create a dropdown helper with the name `input_select.valetudo_room_list`. On creation it needs a single temporary entry.
   Edit this automation yaml for your robot (instead of `valetudo_p10purobot`), and this automation will make the dropdown list for each room on your map with
   an attribute that is the segment number, and keep it up to date. Necessary for the script.
   
 - `clean_route_rest_command.yaml`: example of adding a rest command to Home Assistant for the robot quirks. Comments explain how to obtain details from the Swagger UI.

 - `clean_selected_room_with_robot.yaml`: Script to clean any room on your Valetudo map within Home Assistant. Makes it easier to add multiple ways to clean a room (_e.g._, from
   zigbee remote, timer, absence of occupants, etc). It is in queue mode, so you can call it multiple times, and it will then successively clean each room called.

   It allows quirks for each room, like turning on lights while cleaning and then resetting them to prior state. This helps obstacle avoidance. Similar idea with music, blinds, etc.
   It requires `update_valetudo_vacuum_room_list.yaml`, and provisionally `clean_route_rest_command.yaml`. The latter could easily be removed from the script if undesired.
   Or other quirks could be added.  The options list includes only a few rooms and lights as examples.

 - The script also takes advantage of the useful [docker container](https://github.com/erkexzcx/valetudopng) which allows the telegram message to have a map image. Remove or disable
   this notification if you like, or are not using that container.

 - **Light-weight voice assistant.** If you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running at home, and the [Ollama integration in Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ollama/), there
   is a very low-resource way to use voice assistant. Set up a new agent in the Ollam integration using Llama 3.2:3b. Leave the boxes unchecked to control HA, so there are no entities exposed, it
   should not think before it responds, and keep the maximum memory messages to 0. All of these settings should make it pretty fast on a reasonable CPU. The zero memory seems to be essential to
   keep the LLM from second guessing itself.  I named the agent "list select Llama3.2". Give it the prompt
   
   > You will be given a list, where the members are separated by commas. You should find the member of the list that is most similar to the given object.
   > Your response should be the member only with no other text or brackets. Do not give an explanation. Be sure that your answer is inside  quotation marks.

   Then the automation `voice_activated_cleaning.yaml` should work for calling the robot. You might want to find sentences that seem more natural to you, but now the name you use for the word is
   extremely flexible. I have tried things that are pretty far away from "Master Bedroom" or "Hallway" and it knows what you want.

I like the idea of using smaller LLMs (SLMs?) to do simpler tasks in HA. It seems to me that much of the use in real time is like this: just pick the best member of a list. A python script could probably
do this well enough. I am sure that a smaller LLM could do this job even more efficiently than Llama 3.2 does, but I could not get others to return only what I needed. 

A true LLM would probably be more useful to look at your patterns of behaviour, suggest automations and then write them.
